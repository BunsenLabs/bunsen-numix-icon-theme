BunsenLabs Numix Icon Theme
===========================

Some substituted and additional icons for the Numix-Circle icon theme.

Some alternative themes with recoloured folder icons are provided
which inherit Numix-Circle or Numix-Circle-Light themes, and in turn Numix.

This package depends on numix-icon-theme-circle which depends on numix-icon-theme.

Other additional icons:
BunsenLabs logo

---

NOTE about inheritance.
There are four "common" icon themes which are hidden but which 
the other themes inherit, in order to economise on disk space:

Numix-Bunsen-aqua-common
Numix-Bunsen-darkred-common
These two hold the recoloured Numix folder icons
and are shared by both dark and light themes.


Numix-Bunsen-Dark-common
Numix-Bunsen-Light-common
These two hold icons for either dark or light themes which are the same
for both aqua or darkred themes.

The dark and light sets take precedence over the coloured sets.

For example, Numix-Bunsen-Circle-aqua inherits:
Numix-Bunsen-Dark-common (contains eg BunsenLabs logos for dark themes)
Numix-Bunsen-aqua-common (contains recoloured aqua folders)
Numix-Circle (contains other Numix icons for dark themes)
 - inherits Numix
